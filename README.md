# ðŸŽ¯ Vortex â€” Spin, Win, Repeat!

**Vortex** is a mobile-first decentralized application (dApp) where users turn tiny token amounts into exciting spins on a provably fair wheel.  
Every spin is fun, transparent, and can lead to meaningful rewards â€” all while keeping user control and security at the heart of the experience.

## ðŸŒŸ What is Vortex?

Vortex takes small token balances that are often ignored and turns them into an engaging game experience.  
Users can **spin a wheel** in two ways:

1. **On-chain spinning** â€” Spins are executed directly on the blockchain, with no deposit needed.
2. **Off-chain spinning** â€” Spins happen instantly through a pre-deposited balance for a faster and smoother experience.

ðŸ’¡ Both modes are fair, transparent, and powered by smart contracts.
